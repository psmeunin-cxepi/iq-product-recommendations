## Role
<!--
What this should contain:
- Who/what the agent is (short identity).
- The agent’s primary function in the workflow.
- Any persona/tone constraints if relevant (keep minimal).
- A one-liner on what the agent MUST optimize for (e.g., correctness, grounding).
-->

## Objective
<!--
What this should contain:
- The concrete outcome the agent must produce for the user/workflow.
- Make it testable (“produce X”, “decide Y”, “return Z in schema”).
- Avoid implementation details here; keep it about the end goal.
-->

## Scope
<!--
What this should contain:
- Clear boundaries of what the agent will and will not do.
- Include “In scope” and “Out of scope” bullets.
- Mention any explicit exclusions (e.g., “Do not provide pricing”, “Do not troubleshoot beyond EOL status”).
- Prevents tool/knowledge drift and overreach.
-->

## Instructions
<!--
What this should contain:
- The step-by-step rules the agent must follow to achieve the objective.
- Priority order: what to do first, second, third.
- Grounding rules (how to use RAG/tool outputs vs prior knowledge).
- Decision rules (how to handle missing info, ambiguity, conflicts).
- Tool strategy rules (only if needed): when to call tools, in what order, how to react to empty results.
- Output discipline rules: be concise, list assumptions, avoid speculation, etc.
- Any “never do X” rules that are critical.
-->

## Output Format
<!--
What this should contain:
- The exact output structure expected (JSON schema, markdown structure, fields, required keys).
- Constraints: “JSON only”, “no extra keys”, ordering, max length, etc.
- If you validate outputs with a parser, include the strict contract here.
-->

## Examples (optional)
<!--
What this should contain:
- 1–3 small examples that demonstrate:
  - A correct response in the required format.
  - A “missing context” response pattern.
  - A “conflicting sources/uncertain” response pattern (if relevant).
- Keep examples short and close to real requests.
-->

## Validation Checklist (optional but recommended)
<!--
What this should contain:
- A short checklist the agent should satisfy before responding, e.g.:
  - Did I stay within scope?
  - Are factual claims grounded in provided context/tool results?
  - Did I follow the required output format exactly?
  - Did I clearly call out assumptions/unknowns?
-->

## Special Considerations
<!--
What this should contain:
- Edge cases and domain-specific constraints.
- Terminology and normalization rules (canonical names, ID formats).
- Safety/compliance requirements specific to your org/product.
- Any “do not mention internal implementation” or “don’t expose sensitive info” rules.
-->

## Runtime Context (injected at execution time; optional)
<!--
What this should contain:
- Only include this section if you inject context into the system prompt.
- Otherwise, you can omit it and pass context via message history/tool messages.
- Typical items (use only what your workflow provides):
  - User request (latest message)
  - Relevant conversation history (if needed)
  - Tool outputs (structured results)
  - Retrieved RAG chunks (with metadata boundaries)
-->

### User Request
<!-- {user_request} -->

### Conversation History (optional)
<!-- {conversation_history} -->

### Tool Outputs (optional)
<!-- {tool_outputs} -->

### RAG Context (optional)
<!--
{rag_chunks}
-->
