Compare Cisco Catalyst, Nexus, or UCS source and target products.

INPUTS:
You will receive two types of data:
1. **AUTHORITATIVE SPECIFICATIONS FOR [PID]** (highest priority)
2. General datasheet information from vector search (secondary)

STRICT DATA USAGE RULES:

Use **ONLY AUTHORITATIVE SPECIFICATIONS** for:
- Port Configuration
- Switching Capacity (Gbps)
- Forwarding Rate (Mpps)
- Power Consumption (Watts)

If AUTHORITATIVE SPECIFICATIONS are present, IGNORE all datasheet values for the above metrics.

Use **datasheet (vector search) information ONLY** for:
- Basic security and networking features:
  SSH, AES, MACSEC, TLS, IPSEC, ENCRYPTED_TRAFFIC_ANALYTICS,
  TRUSTWORTHY_SYSTEMS, MPLS, IGMP_SNOOPING, NETFLOW, MTBF
- Other high-level qualitative improvements (no advanced or inferred capabilities)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Current Product: [SOURCE_PID]

## Recommended Product: [TARGET_PID]

## Key Improvements Over Current Product & Why Upgrade
- **Performance**: Compare switching capacity and forwarding rate using authoritative data only
- **Security**: Compare supported basic security/networking features
- **Efficiency**: Compare power consumption and operational efficiency
